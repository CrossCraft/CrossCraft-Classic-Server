---
A Minecraft Server compatible with CrossCraft Classic and all standard Minecraft Classic clients. This server implements Protocol Version 7 (Compatible with Minecraft Classic v0.30)

CrossCraft-Classic is a project that aims to recreate Minecraft Java Edition: Classic without looking at any of the source code of the original application and without using the original copyrighted assets. All knowledge is figured out with an understanding of in-game mechanics and is approximated to be as close as possible to the original.

The CrossCraft-Classic-Server is available on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

We are not associated with Mojang or Microsoft.
